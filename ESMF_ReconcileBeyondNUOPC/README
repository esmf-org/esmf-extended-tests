ESMF Reconcile Non-NUOPC test

The test is designed to run a variety of test cases to stress the ESMF_StateReconcile
algorithm. It's set up to allow cases beyond those allowed by NUOPC to allow for
more general testing. 

After setting ESMFMKFILE the test can be built with 'make'.  Doing 'make clean' should
remove any temporary files created during the builds.

You run the test by doing the following:
mpirun -np 8 ./ESMF_ReconcileNonNUOPC test.config
where test.config is a config file specifying the case.


The following is an example of the config file format: 

compCount:  2  # Number of components

# List of components from 1 to the number
<comp-01:   
  petListBounds: 0 3   # Each component should have a petListBound here they are absolute
  stateMembers: fields-A  # List of the members of the State being added in this component
  <fields-A:   # fields-A means that this is a list of Fields with name A, the names have to be unique across all the components
    count: 10  # number of fields build with this name
    typekind: R8  # type of the field
    geom: grid-A  # This set of fields will be built on a Grid
  :fields-A>  
:comp-01>

<comp-02:
  petListBoundsRel: 0.3 1.0   # Here we see relative Pet list bounds that will change with the petCount
  stateMembers: fields-B fields-C
  <fields-B:
    count: 20
    typekind: R8
    geom: mesh-B # This set of fields will be built on a Mesh
  :fields-B>
  <fields-C:
    count: 5
    typekind: I4
    geom: grid-C
  :fields-C>
:comp-02>
