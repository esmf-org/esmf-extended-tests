CompWeights
===========

This is a tool for comparing weights generated by ESMF_RegridWeightGen when using the NativeMesh vs MBMesh backend to the ESMF Mesh.

This tool requires Python3 with numpy, pandas, click and psutil installed.

This is one way to create a virtual environment to use when running this tool:

    python3 -m venv compweights
    source ~/compweights/bin/activate
    pip <--user> install numpy pandas click psutil
