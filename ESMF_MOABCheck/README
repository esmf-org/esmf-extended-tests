                        README - ESMF_RegridWeightGenCheck

                    Earth System Modeling Framework (ESMF)

================================================================================

Hello, this is the README file for the ESMF_MOABCheck external demo.
This demo runs the ESMF_RegridWeightGen application in ESMF on several sets
of grid files both with and without MOAB. It checks the weights in the two
files to make sure they are the same.

ESMF must be built and installed for this testing application to run properly.

The ESMF library must be built with NetCDF support.

If the ESMF library has already been built on the system you are using, you 
should only have to set the ESMFMKFILE environment variable.
This environment variable should be pointed to the esmf.mk file in the INSTALLED 
version of the ESMF library.

Some useful commands you can issue in this directory:

gmake run   - run the application
gmake dryrun - download the input grid files without running the demo
gmake dust  - clean out .o and .mod files
gmake clean - clean the directory and start over

The input grid files will be downloaded from http:www.earthsystemmodeling.org/download/data and stored in the input directory.  If you would like to test
with a different set of data files you must put them in the input directory.  The 
new test case can then be added to the RegridTestData.txt file.
