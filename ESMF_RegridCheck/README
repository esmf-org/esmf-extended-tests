                        README - ESMF_RegridCheck

                    Earth System Modeling Framework (ESMF)

================================================================================

Hello, this is the README file for the ESMF_RegridCheck external demo.
This demo runs the ESMF_Regrid application in ESMF on several sets
of grid files.  It also validates the resulting data variable against an analytic
field by checking for interpolation errors.

ESMF must be built and installed for this testing application to run properly.

The ESMF library must be built with NetCDF support.

If the ESMF library has already been built on the system you are using, you 
should only have to set the ESMFMKFILE environment variable.
This environment variable should be pointed to the esmf.mk file in the INSTALLED 
version of the ESMF library.

Some useful commands you can issue in this directory:

gmake run   - run the application
gmake dryrun - download the input grid files without running the demo
gmake dust  - clean out .o and .mod files
gmake clean - clean the directory and start over

The input grid files will be downloaded from http://www.earthsystemmodeling.org/download/data 
and stored in the input directory.  If you would like to test
with a different set of data files you must put them in the input directory.  The 
new test case can then be added to the RegridTestData.txt file.

In order to check the regridded results, all the input data variables used in this
external demo were synthetically constructed using the following formula:

data(i,j,k,l) = 2.0 + cos(lat(i,j))**2*cos(2.0*lon(i,j)) + (k-1) + 2*(l-1)

The data variable can be up to four dimensional, with the first two dimension being the 
longitude and latitude.
